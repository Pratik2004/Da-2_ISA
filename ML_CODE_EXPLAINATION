Sure! I'll explain each line of the code:

```python
import numpy as np
```
This line imports the NumPy library, which is a popular library for numerical computations in Python.

```python
class FullyConnectedLayer:
```
This line defines a class named `FullyConnectedLayer`, which represents a fully connected layer in a neural network.

```python
    def __init__(self, input_size, output_size):
```
This is the initializer method of the `FullyConnectedLayer` class. It gets called when an instance of the class is created and initializes the weights and biases of the layer based on the specified `input_size` and `output_size`.

```python
        self.weights = np.random.randn(input_size, output_size)
```
This line initializes the `weights` attribute of the `FullyConnectedLayer` instance with random values drawn from a standard normal distribution using NumPy's `np.random.randn()` function.

```python
        self.biases = np.zeros(output_size)
```
This line initializes the `biases` attribute of the `FullyConnectedLayer` instance with zeros using NumPy's `np.zeros()` function.

```python
    def forward(self, inputs):
```
This is the forward method of the `FullyConnectedLayer` class. It performs the forward pass computation of the layer given an input and returns the output of the layer.

```python
        self.inputs = inputs
```
This line stores the input in the `inputs` attribute of the `FullyConnectedLayer` instance.

```python
        self.output = np.dot(inputs, self.weights) + self.biases
```
This line computes the output of the layer by performing a dot product between the input and the weights, and then adding the biases to the result.

```python
        return self.output
```
This line returns the computed output of the layer.

```python
    def backward(self, grad_output, learning_rate):
```
This is the backward method of the `FullyConnectedLayer` class. It performs the backward pass computation of the layer given the gradient of the loss with respect to the layer's output (`grad_output`) and the learning rate (`learning_rate`).

```python
        grad_input = np.dot(grad_output, self.weights.T)
```
This line computes the gradient of the loss with respect to the layer's input by performing a dot product between the gradient of the loss with respect to the layer's output and the transpose of the weights.

```python
        grad_weights = np.dot(self.inputs.T, grad_output)
```
This line computes the gradient of the loss with respect to the layer's weights by performing a dot product between the transpose of the inputs and the gradient of the loss with respect to the layer's output.

```python
        grad_biases = np.sum(grad_output, axis=0)
```
This line computes the gradient of the loss with respect to the layer's biases by summing the gradient of the loss with respect to the layer's output along the axis 0 (columns).

```python
        self.weights -= learning_rate * grad_weights
```
This line updates the weights of the layer by subtracting the product of the learning rate and the gradient of the loss with respect to the weights.

```python
        self.biases -= learning_rate * grad_biases
```
This line updates the biases of the layer by subtracting the product of the learning rate and the gradient of the loss with respect to the biases.

```python
        return grad_input
```
This line returns the computed gradient of the loss with respect to the layer's input.

```python
class ReLUActivation:
```
This line defines a class named `ReLUActivation`, which represents the rectified linear unit activation function.

```python
    def forward(self, inputs):
```
This is the forward method of the `ReLUActivation` class. It performs the forward pass computation of the activation function given an input and returns the output.

```python
        self.inputs = inputs
```
This line stores the input in the `inputs` attribute of the `ReLUActivation` instance.

```python
        return np.maximum(0, inputs)
```
This line applies the rectified linear unit function element-wise to the input using NumPy's `np.maximum()` function, which returns the maximum value between 0 and the input element.

```python
    def backward(self, grad_output):
```
This is the backward method of the `ReLUActivation` class. It performs the backward pass computation of the activation function given the gradient of the loss with respect to the activation function's output (`grad_output`).

```python
        grad_input = grad_output.copy()
```
This line creates a copy of the gradient of the loss with respect to the activation function's output.

```python
        grad_input[self.inputs < 0] = 0
```
This line sets the elements of the copied gradient to 0 where the corresponding elements of the stored inputs are less than 0, effectively zeroing out negative gradients.

```python
        return grad_input
```
This line returns the computed gradient of the loss with respect to the activation function's input.

The remaining lines demonstrate the usage of the defined classes, where instances of `FullyConnectedLayer` and `ReLUActivation` are created, and forward and backward passes are performed on randomly generated inputs.

Please note that this code represents a simple implementation of a fully connected layer and ReLU activation for learning purposes and may not include all the necessary optimizations and functionality needed for practical applications.
